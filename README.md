PS ~ This code was built in 2010. Built in PHP 5.3. The code doesn't use an MVC structure or any framework.
Released with a thought of helping someone to know how a conferencing platform and its different technologies work together.
Please read the NOTE at the end of this doc.
I'd try to put a working demo of this online soon.

> Note:
> - The PHP version shall be latest with respect to 2010, hence you might need to handle some depreciated methods if faced.
> - The developer might need some basic idea of how to use the Red5 server.
> - Edit the configs according to your environment, database, and namespaces you create
> - The chat script is very basic one using direct db transaction. Recommend to implement jabber or similar technique.
